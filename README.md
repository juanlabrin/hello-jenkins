## Small Java App for Testing Jenkins Installation

This little java app is only for the purpose to test the Jenkins CI/CD server installation.

## Folder Structure and Files

The workspace contains two folders by default, and a Pipeline Jenkinsfile where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `Jenkinsfile`: A Jenkinsfile is a text file that contains the definition of a Jenkins Pipeline and is checked into source control.

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default
